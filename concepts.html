                    <h2>Fundamentals of Programming</h2>
                    <p> Most object oriented programming languages share a set of common concepts that transfer to other object oriented programming languages. In the case of FTC, using a Java-based programming system allows for the flexibiltiy of Java, though with the relatively low computing power of the legal Android phones.</p>
                    <h3>Variable Types</h3>
                    <p>There are many different kinds of variables in Java, but for FTC, the ones that you are most likely going to come in contact with are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integers<ul><li>You'll use these to hold numbers without decimals.</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Doubles<ul><li>This is a variable for numbers that also includes decimals.</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Booleans<ul><li>True and false statements will be played off of booleans.</li></ul></li>
                        <li>Strings<ul><li>For anything you want to hold in text form, you'd use strings.</li></ul></li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Basic Control Structures</h3>
                    <p>In addition to capturing data, it's also important to know how to manipulate that data in a productive way. Some of these control structures include if/else statements and assorted loop statements. In a simplified manner, these statements check a boolean and execute a certain action depending on the state of the boolean.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the if/else statement, the program executes the "if" statement if the boolean is "true", and the "else" statement if the boolean is "false". For most loops, however, the program instead keeps executing a certain command until the boolean condition becomes "false". </p>
                    <h3>More Resources</h3>
                    <p>Though there is a fair bit to refresh on, there is not enough time or space to explain Java in its entirety. Below are some resources that you can further your exploration of Java through.</p>
