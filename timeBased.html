                    <h2>Time Based Auto</h2>
                    <p>The most basic kind of autonomous robot movement is time-based. These closed loop autonomous programs have the robot apply a certain voltage to its motors for a specific amount of time. Though simple, these kinds of movements are prone to error, as a small difference in the charge of a battery could disrupt what was measured earlier to be a perfect run.</p>
                    <h3>Basic Setup</h3>
                    <p> A time-based autonomous is not very complicated. However, the basic setup necessary for the robots to be able to run the autonomous is indeed difficult.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The class extends LinearOpMode, which executed everything after the waitForStart(); method in order top to bottom.</li>
                        <li>After instantiating two instances of the DcMotor class with value as null, the runOpMode method begins. </li>
                        <li>The two motors are then set to the motors in the hardwareMap under the names "leftMotor" and "rightMotor".</li>
                        <li>After the program has been started, a timer is created, and then reset.</li>
                        <li>The motors are set to a certain power. After four seconds have passed, the powers are set back to zero. </li>
